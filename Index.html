                        <p>"Been sending my pup there for full grooming since he was only months old. I love how I am always updated of any conditions noticed no matter how small. He always comes back home smelling like a baby, razor burn free, and most importantly still happy. And the staff are always friendly, happily accomodating to different requests each session. Plus free transport to and fro! We've tried different groomers for a change but always end up with Pet Dynasty. We really appreciate the team for their hard work and effort in keeping our pups happy and clean!"</p>

Carol advised accordingly on what should change in his diet so to better his condition. No groommer has gone this extent for us. My boys smell amazing when they came home. We can see the skin folds and affected areas on our beagle being cleaned. We also received updates in the midst as well and that was absolutely assuring. No signs of stress but absolute joy on our boys' faces. Their transport is clean and neat as well".</p>

                        <p>"Highly recommended! They able to accommodate to my last minute request to do a full grooming for my precious boy (Jojo) and allowed me to bring my dog earlier for the appointment so I could pick him up after work. Surprised to hear my dog was well-behaved but nonetheless he was so pretty. The best part was my dog didnâ€™t throw his temper this time for grooming, I guess he did enjoy his grooming. Because he will be throwing his temper after grooming and looks extremely down.
                            Good job! Will be bringing him down for next grooming."</p>
